# Information about submission for SBA

##HTML
* The three pages for the HTML requirement are CreateAccount.html, HomeScreen.html, and Login.html which are all found in the DominickSpinettiHTML folder.
##CSS 
* Both CreateAccount.html and Login.html use an external stylesheet (main.css) which is found in the CSS folder.
##Javascript and regex validation
* The main reference for the form validation is handled by bootstrap but a JavaScript file found in the script folder handles the form validation for the create account page as a backup in case the bootstrap link fails and to fulfil the requirements for the assignment.
##Description of website
* The idea of the website is to provide a platform where the user can select a golf course from the application and view a play by play of each hole and some individuals strategies or tips and tricks. 
* Because I am using my case study project for this SBA, the application is unfinished but for the  purpose of completing the assignment, each file provided meets the asked requirements of the SBA.
